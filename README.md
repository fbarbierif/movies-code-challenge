# movies-code-challenge

Repository for Movies Code Challenge. 

This project lists the most popular TV shows indicating their image, their rating and a brief description of each one.

## Description and architecture

Project uses the MVP pattern to consume a REST service that through a paged GET I ask for a list of items. 
Once I obtained the items I list them in a recyclerview.

I use retrofit to make the call and the Fresco library for loading images.
